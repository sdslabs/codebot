    <p>Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a &le; b &le; c.   (AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).<br />  The angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).  </p>    <img src="project/images/p_257_bisector.gif" /><br />    <p>  The segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.<br />  It can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.<br />  However, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.  </p>  <p>  How many triangles ABC with perimeter&le;100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?  </p>
