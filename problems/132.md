  <p>A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k.</p>  <p>For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11&times;41&times;271&times;9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.</p>  <p>Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(109).</p>
