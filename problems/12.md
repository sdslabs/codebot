  <p>The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:</p>  <p style="text-align:center;">1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...</p>  <p>Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:</p>  &nbsp;1: 1<br />  &nbsp;3: 1,3<br />  &nbsp;6: 1,2,3,6<br />  10: 1,2,5,10<br />  15: 1,3,5,15<br />  21: 1,3,7,21<br />  28: 1,2,4,7,14,28  <p>We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.</p>  <p>What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?</p>
