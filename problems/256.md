    <p>Tatami are rectangular mats, used to completely cover the floor of a room, without overlap.</p>    <p>Assuming that the only type of available tatami has dimensions 1&times;2, there are obviously some limitations for the shape and size of the rooms that can be covered.</p>    <p>For this problem, we consider only rectangular rooms with integer dimensions a, b and even size s = a&middot;b.<br />  We use the term 'size' to denote the floor surface area of the room, and &mdash; without loss of generality &mdash; we add the condition a &le; b.</p>    <p>There is one rule to follow when laying out tatami: there must be no points where corners of four different mats meet.<br />  For example, consider the two arrangements below for a 4&times;4 room:</p>    <img src="project/images/p_256_tatami3.gif" /><br />      <p>The arrangement on the left is acceptable, whereas the one on the right is not: a red "X" in the middle, marks the point where four tatami meet.</p>    <p>Because of this rule, certain even-sized rooms cannot be covered with tatami: we call them tatami-free rooms.<br />  Further, we define T(s) as the number of tatami-free rooms of size s.</p>    <p>The smallest tatami-free room has size s = 70 and dimensions 7&times;10.<br />  All the other rooms of size s = 70 can be covered with tatami; they are: 1&times;70, 2&times;35 and 5&times;14.<br />  Hence, T(70) = 1.</p>    <p>Similarly, we can verify that T(1320) = 5 because there are exactly 5 tatami-free rooms of size s = 1320:<br />  20&times;66, 22&times;60, 24&times;55, 30&times;44 and 33&times;40.<br />  In fact, s = 1320 is the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 5.</p>    <p>Find the smallest room-size s for which T(s) = 200.</p>
