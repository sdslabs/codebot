   <p>A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:</p>    1/2=&nbsp;0.5   1/3=&nbsp;0.(3)   1/4=&nbsp;0.25   1/5=&nbsp;0.2   1/6=&nbsp;0.1(6)   1/7=&nbsp;0.(142857)   1/8=&nbsp;0.125   1/9=&nbsp;0.(1)   1/10=&nbsp;0.1    <p>Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.</p> <p>Find the value of d &lt; 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.</p>
