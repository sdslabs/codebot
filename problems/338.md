  <p>A rectangular sheet of grid paper with integer dimensions w &times; h is given. Its grid spacing is 1.<br />  When we cut the sheet along the grid lines into two pieces and rearrange those pieces without overlap, we can make new rectangles with different dimensions.</p>  <p>For example, from a sheet with dimensions 9 &times; 4 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 &times; 2, 12 &times; 3 and 6 &times; 6 by cutting and rearranging as below:</p>      <img src="project/images/p_338_gridpaper.gif" /><br />      <p>Similarly, from a sheet with dimensions 9 &times; 8 , we can make rectangles with dimensions 18 &times; 4 and 12 &times; 6 .</p>    <p>For a pair w and h, let F(w,h) be the number of distinct rectangles that can be made from a sheet with dimensions w &times; h .<br />  For example, F(2,1) = 0, F(2,2) = 1, F(9,4) = 3 and F(9,8) = 2. <br />  Note that rectangles congruent to the initial one are not counted in F(w,h).<br />  Note also that rectangles with dimensions w &times; h and dimensions h &times; w are not considered distinct.</p>    <p>For an integer N, let G(N) be the sum of F(w,h) for all pairs w and h which satisfy 0 &lt; h &le; w &le; N.<br />  We can verify that G(10) = 55, G(103) = 971745 and G(105) = 9992617687.</p>    <p>Find G(1012). Give your answer modulo 108.</p>
