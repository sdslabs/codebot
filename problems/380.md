  <p>  An m&times;n maze is an m&times;n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square. <br />The following are examples of a 9&times;12 maze and a 15&times;20 maze:  </p>  <p>  <img src=project/images/p_380_mazes.gif />  </p>  <p>  Let C(m,n) be the number of distinct m&times;n mazes. Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.  </p>  <p>  It can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).<br />  Find C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits.  </p>  <p>  When giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.  E.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.    </p>
