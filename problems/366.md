  <p>  Two players, Anton and Bernhard, are playing the following game.<br />  There is one pile of n stones.<br />  The first player may remove any positive number of stones, but not the whole pile.<br />  Thereafter, each player may remove at most twice the number of stones his opponent took on the previous move.<br />  The player who removes the last stone wins.  </p>  <p>  E.g. n=5<br />  If the first player takes anything more than one stone the next player will be able to take all remaining stones.<br />  If the first player takes one stone, leaving four, his opponent will take also one stone, leaving three stones.<br />  The first player cannot take all three because he may take at most 2x1=2 stones. So let's say he takes also one stone, leaving 2. The second player can take the two remaining stones and wins.<br />  So 5 is a losing position for the first player.<br />  For some winning positions there is more than one possible move for the first player.<br />  E.g. when n=17 the first player can remove one or four stones.  </p>  <p>  Let M(n) be the maximum number of stones the first player can take from a winning position at his first turn and M(n)=0 for any other position.  </p>  <p>  <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />M(n) for n&le;100 is 728.  </p>  <p>  Find  <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />M(n) for n&le;1018.  Give your answer modulo 108.  </p>
