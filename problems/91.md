  <p>The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form &Delta;OPQ.</p>      <img src="project/images/p_091_1.gif" alt="" /><br />      <p>There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,<br />0 &le; x1, y1, x2, y2 &le; 2.</p>      <img src="project/images/p_091_2.gif" alt="" /><br />      <p>Given that 0 &le; x1, y1, x2, y2 &le; 50, how many right triangles can be formed?</p>
