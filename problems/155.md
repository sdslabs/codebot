  An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.  <br />  The capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.  Using this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 <img src='project/images/p_155_capsmu.gif' width='12' height='21' alt=''  style='vertical-align:middle;' />F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values:   <img src='project/images/p_155_capacitors1.gif' width='387' height='557' alt='' />  If we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...  Find D(18).  Reminder : When connecting capacitors C1, C2 etc in parallel, the total capacitance is CT&nbsp;=&nbsp;C1&nbsp;+&nbsp;C2&nbsp;+...,  <br />  whereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:  <img src='project/images/p_155_capsform.gif' width='127' height='38' alt=''  style='vertical-align:middle;' />
