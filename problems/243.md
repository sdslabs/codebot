  <p> </p>  <p>A positive fraction whose numerator is less than its denominator is called a proper fraction.<br />  For any denominator, d, there will be d<img src='images/symbol_minus.gif' width='9' height='3' alt='&minus;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />1 proper fractions; for example, with d&thinsp;=&thinsp;12:<br />  1/12 , 2/12 , 3/12 , 4/12 , 5/12 , 6/12 , 7/12 , 8/12 , 9/12 , 10/12 , 11/12 .  </p>    <p>We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction.<br />  Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4/11 .<br />  In fact, d&thinsp;=&thinsp;12 is the smallest denominator having a resilience R(d) < 4/10 .</p>    <p>Find the smallest denominator d, having a resilience R(d) < 15499/94744 .</p>
