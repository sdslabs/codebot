  <p>An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.</p>    <p>Partitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.  A partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which every part occurs at most once.</p>    <p>The partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:  <br/>5, 4+1 and 3+2.</p>    <p>Let f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such partition of n with that product.</p>    <p>So f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.</p>    <p>For n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.  <br/>And their product, f(10)&middot;m(10) = 30&middot;3 = 90</p>    <p>It can be verified that  <br/><img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />f(n)&middot;m(n) for 1 &le; n &le; 100 = 1683550844462.</p>    <p>Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />f(n)&middot;m(n) for 1 &le; n &le; 1014.  <br/>Give your answer modulo 982451653, the 50 millionth prime.</p>
