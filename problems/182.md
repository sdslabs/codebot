  <p>The RSA encryption is based on the following procedure:</p>  <p>Generate two distinct primes p and q.<br />Compute n=pq and &phi;=(p-1)(q-1).<br />  Find an integer e, 1&lt;e&lt;&phi;, such that gcd(e,&phi;)=1.</p>  <p>A message in this system is a number in the interval [0,n-1].<br />  A text to be encrypted is then somehow converted to messages (numbers in the interval [0,n-1]).<br />  To encrypt the text,  for each message, m, c=me mod n is calculated.</p>  <p>To decrypt the text, the following procedure is needed: calculate d such that ed=1 mod &phi;, then for each encrypted message, c, calculate m=cd mod n.</p>  <p>There exist values of e and m  such that me mod n=m.<br />We call messages m for which me mod n=m unconcealed messages.</p>  <p>An issue when choosing e is that there should not be too many unconcealed messages.  <br />For instance, let p=19 and q=37.<br />  Then n=19*37=703 and &phi;=18*36=648.<br />  If we choose e=181, then, although gcd(181,648)=1 it turns out that all possible messages<br />   m (0&le;m&le;n-1) are unconcealed when calculating me mod n.<br />  For any valid choice of e there exist some unconcealed messages.<br />  It's important that the number of unconcealed messages is at a minimum.</p>  <p>Choose p=1009 and q=3643.<br />  Find the sum of all values of e, 1&lt;e&lt;&phi;(1009,3643) and gcd(e,&phi;)=1, so that the number of unconcealed messages for this value of e is at a minimum.</p>
