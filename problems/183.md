  <p>Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r = N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.<br />  Let P be the product of these parts, P = r &times; r &times; ... &times; r = rk.</p>    <p>For example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.25 = 51.53632.</p>    <p>Let M(N) = Pmax for a given value of N.</p>    <p>It turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to Pmax = (11/4)4; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.</p>    <p>However, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.</p>    <p>Let D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is a terminating decimal.</p>    <p>For example, &Sigma;D(N) for 5 &le; N &le; 100 is 2438.</p>    <p>Find &Sigma;D(N) for 5 &le; N &le; 10000.</p>
