  <p>Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:</p>    <img src="project/images/p_189_grid.gif" alt="" />    <p>We wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.<br />  Note: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours.</p>     <p>For example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:</p>  <img src="project/images/p_189_colours.gif" alt="" />    <p>A colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered distinct from C unless the two are identical.</p>    <p>How many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?</p>
