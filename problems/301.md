  <p>Nim is a game played with heaps of stones, where two players take it in turn to remove any number of stones from any heap until no stones remain.</p>    <p>We'll consider the three-heap normal-play version of Nim, which works as follows:<br />  - At the start of the game there are three heaps of stones.<br />  - On his turn the player removes any positive number of stones from any single heap.<br />  - The first player unable to move (because no stones remain) loses.</p>    <p> If (n1,n2,n3) indicates a Nim position consisting of heaps of size n1, n2 and n3 then there is a simple function X(n1,n2,n3) &mdash; that you may look up or attempt to deduce for yourself &mdash; that returns:  zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually lose; or  non-zero if, with perfect strategy, the player about to move will eventually win.  </p>    <p>For example X(1,2,3) = 0 because, no matter what the current player does, his opponent can respond with a move that leaves two heaps of equal size, at which point every move by the current player can be mirrored by his opponent until no stones remain; so the current player loses. To illustrate:<br />  - current player moves to (1,2,1)<br />  - opponent moves to (1,0,1)<br />  - current player moves to (0,0,1)<br />  - opponent moves to (0,0,0), and so wins.</p>    <p>For how many positive integers n&thinsp;&le;&thinsp;230 does X(n,2n,3n) = 0 ?  </p>
