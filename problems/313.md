  In a sliding game a counter may slide horizontally or vertically into an empty space. The objective of the game is to move the red counter from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner; the space always starts in the bottom right corner. For example, the following sequence of pictures show how the game can be completed in five moves on a 2 by 2 grid.    <img src="project/images/p_313_sliding_game_1.gif" />    Let S(m,n) represent the minimum number of moves to complete the game on an m by n grid. For example, it can be verified that S(5,4) = 25.    <img src="project/images/p_313_sliding_game_2.gif" />    There are exactly 5482 grids for which S(m,n) = p2, where p <img src='images/symbol_lt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&lt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 100 is prime.    How many grids does S(m,n) = p2, where p <img src='images/symbol_lt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&lt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 106 is prime?
