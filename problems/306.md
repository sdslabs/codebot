  The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:    Two players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate turns.<br />  On each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.<br />  The first player who cannot make a move loses.      If n = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.  If n = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player loses.  If n = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.  If n = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can win the game by painting the two middle squares.  If n = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red); but no matter what she does, the second player (blue) wins.    <img src="project/images/p_306_pstrip.gif" />      So, for 1 <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 5, there are 3 values of n for which the first player can force a win.<br />  Similarly, for 1 <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 50, there are 40 values of n for which the first player can force a win.    For 1 <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> n <img src='images/symbol_le.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&le;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1 000 000, how many values of n are there for which the first player can force a win?
