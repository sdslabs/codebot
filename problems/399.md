  <p>  The first 15 fibonacci numbers are:<br />  1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610.<br />  It can be seen that 8 and 144 are not squarefree: 8 is divisible by 4 and 144 is divisible by 4 and by 9.<br />   So the first 13 squarefree fibonacci numbers are:<br />  1,1,2,3,5,13,21,34,55,89,233,377 and 610.  </p>  <p>  The 200th squarefree fibonacci number is:  971183874599339129547649988289594072811608739584170445.<br />  The last sixteen digits of this number are: 1608739584170445 and in scientific notation this number can be written as 9.7e53.  </p>  <p>  Find the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number.<br />  Give as your answer its last sixteen digits followed by a comma followed by the number in scientific notation (rounded to one digit after the decimal point).<br />  For the 200th squarefree number the answer would have been: 1608739584170445,9.7e53  </p>  <p>    Note:<br />   For this problem, assume that for every prime p, the first fibonacci number divisible by p is not divisible by p2 (this is part of Wall's conjecture). This has been verified for primes &le; 3·1015, but has not been proven in general.<br />    If it happens that the conjecture is false, then the accepted answer to this problem isn't guaranteed to be the 100 000 000th squarefree fibonacci number, rather it represents only a lower bound for that number.    </p>
