  <p>The rules for writing Roman numerals allow for many ways of writing each number (see About Roman Numerals...). However, there is always a &quot;best&quot; way of writing a particular number.</p>  <p>For example, the following represent all of the legitimate ways of writing the number sixteen:</p>  <p style="margin-left:50px;font-family:courier new,monospace;">IIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br />  VIIIIIIIIIII<br />  VVIIIIII<br />  XIIIIII<br />  VVVI<br />  XVI</p>  <p>The last example being considered the most efficient, as it uses the least number of numerals.</p>  <p>The 11K text file, roman.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), contains one thousand numbers written in valid, but not necessarily minimal, Roman numerals; that is, they are arranged in descending units and obey the subtractive pair rule (see About Roman Numerals... for the definitive rules for this problem).</p>  <p>Find the number of characters saved by writing each of these in their minimal form.</p>  <p class="info">Note: You can assume that all the Roman numerals in the file contain no more than four consecutive identical units.</p>
