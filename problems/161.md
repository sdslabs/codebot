  <p>A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.  There are two basic forms:</p>    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_161_trio1.gif" alt="" /></p>    <p>If all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:</p>    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_161_trio3.gif" alt="" /></p>    <p>Any n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes.<br />  If we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be  tiled with triominoes:</p>    <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_161_k9.gif" alt="" /></p>    <p>In how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?</p>
