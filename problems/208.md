  <p>A robot moves in a series of one-fifth circular arcs (72&deg;), with a free choice of a clockwise or an anticlockwise arc for each step, but no turning on the spot.</p>    <p>One of 70932 possible closed paths of 25 arcs starting northward is</p>    <img src="http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_208_robotwalk.gif" alt="" />      <p>Given that the robot starts facing North, how many journeys of 70 arcs in length can it take that return it, after the final arc, to its starting position?<br />    (Any arc may be traversed multiple times.)   </p>
