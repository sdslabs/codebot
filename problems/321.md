  <p>A horizontal row comprising of 2n + 1 squares has n red counters placed at one end and n blue counters at the other end, being separated by a single empty square in the centre. For example, when n = 3.</p>    <p><img src="project/images/p_321_swapping_counters_1.gif" /></p>    <p>A counter can move from one square to the next (slide) or can jump over another counter (hop) as long as the square next to that counter is unoccupied.</p>    <p><img src="project/images/p_321_swapping_counters_2.gif" /></p>    <p>Let M(n) represent the minimum number of moves/actions to completely reverse the positions of the coloured counters; that is, move all the red counters to the right and all the blue counters to the left.</p>  <p>It can be verified M(3) = 15, which also happens to be a triangle number.</p>    <p>If we create a sequence based on the values of n for which M(n) is a triangle number then the first five terms would be:  <br>1, 3, 10, 22, and 63, and their sum would be 99.</p>    <p>Find the sum of the first forty terms of this sequence.</p>
