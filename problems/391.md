  <p>  Let sk be the number of 1&rsquo;s when writing the numbers from 0 to k in binary.<br />  For example, writing 0 to 5 in binary, we have 0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101. There are seven 1&rsquo;s, so s5 = 7.<br />  The sequence S = {sk : k <img src='images/symbol_ge.gif' width='10' height='12' alt='&ge;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 0} starts {0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, ...}.<br />  </p>    <p>  A game is played by two players. Before the game starts, a number n is chosen. A counter c starts at 0. At each turn, the player chooses a number from 1 to n (inclusive) and increases c by that number. The resulting value of c must be a member of S. If there are no more valid moves, the player loses.  </p>    <p>  For example:<br />  Let n = 5. c starts at 0.<br />  Player 1 chooses 4, so c becomes 0 + 4 = 4.<br />  Player 2 chooses 5, so c becomes 4 + 5 = 9.<br />  Player 1 chooses 3, so c becomes 9 + 3 = 12.<br />  etc.<br />  Note that c must always belong to S, and each player can increase c by at most n.  </p>    <p>  Let M(n) be the highest number the first player can choose at her first turn to force a win, and M(n) = 0 if there is no such move. For example, M(2) = 2, M(7) = 1 and M(20) = 4.  </p>    <p>  Given &Sigma;(M(n))3 = 8150 for 1 &le; n &le; 20.  </p>    <p>  Find &Sigma;(M(n))3 for 1 &le; n &le; 1000.  </p>
