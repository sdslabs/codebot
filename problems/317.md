  <p>  A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.  </p>  <p>  We assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.  </p>  <p>  Find the volume (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground.   Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.  </p>
