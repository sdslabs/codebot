  <p>A 30&times;30 grid of squares contains 900 fleas, initially one flea per square.<br />  When a bell is rung, each flea jumps to an adjacent square at random (usually 4 possibilities, except for fleas on the edge of the grid or at the corners).</p>    <p>What is the expected number of unoccupied squares after 50 rings of the bell? Give your answer rounded to six decimal places.</p>
