  <p>  k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).  </p>  <p>  Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.<br />  For instance p(3,7) <img src='images/symbol_asymp.gif' width='11' height='9' alt='&asymp;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 0.0204081633.  </p>  <p>  Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij  </p>
