  <p>A Harshad or Niven number is a number that is divisible by the sum of its digits.  <br/>201 is a Harshad number because it is divisible by 3 (the sum of its digits.)  <br/>When we truncate the last digit from 201, we get 20, which is a Harshad number.  <br/>When we truncate the last digit from 20, we get 2, which is also a Harshad number.  <br/>Let's call a Harshad number that, while recursively truncating the last digit, always results in a Harshad number a right truncatable Harshad number.</p>      <p>Also:  <br/>201/3=67 which is prime.  <br/>Let's call a Harshad number that, when divided by the sum of its digits, results in a prime a strong Harshad number.</p>    <p>Now take the number 2011 which is prime.  <br/>When we truncate the last digit from it we get 201, a strong Harshad number that is also right truncatable.  <br/>Let's call such primes strong, right truncatable Harshad primes.</p>    <p>You are given that the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 10000 is 90619.</p>    <p>Find the sum of the strong, right truncatable Harshad primes less than 1014.</p>
