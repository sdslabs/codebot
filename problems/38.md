  <p>Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:</p>  192 &times; 1 = 192<br />  192 &times; 2 = 384<br />  192 &times; 3 = 576  <p>By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)</p>  <p>The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).</p>  <p>What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n <img src='images/symbol_gt.gif' width='10' height='10' alt='&gt;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' /> 1?</p>
