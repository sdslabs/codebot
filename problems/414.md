  <p>  6174 is a remarkable number; if we sort its digits in increasing order and subtract that number from the number you get when you sort the digits in decreasing order, we get 7641-1467=6174.<br />  Even more remarkable is that if we start from any 4 digit number and repeat this process of sorting and subtracting, we'll eventually end up with 6174 or immediately with 0 if all digits are equal.<br />   This also works with numbers that have less than 4 digits if we pad the number with leading zeroes until we have 4 digits.<br />  E.g. let's start with the number 0837:<br />  8730-0378=8352<br />  8532-2358=6174  </p>  <p>  6174 is called the Kaprekar constant. The process of sorting and subtracting and repeating this until either 0 or the Kaprekar constant is reached is called the Kaprekar routine.  </p>  <p>  We can consider the Kaprekar routine for other bases and number of digits.<br />   Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed a Kaprekar constant exists in all cases; either the routine can end up in a cycle for some input numbers or the constant the routine arrives at can be different for different input numbers.<br >  However, it can be shown that for 5 digits and a base b = 6t+3<img src='images/symbol_ne.gif' width='11' height='10' alt='&ne;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />9, a Kaprekar constant exists.<br />  E.g. base 15: (10,4,14,9,5)15<br />  base 21: (14,6,20,13,7)21  </p>  <p>  Define Cb to be the Kaprekar constant in base b for 5 digits.  Define the function sb(i) to be      0 if i = Cb or if i written in base b consists of 5 identical digits   the number of iterations it takes the Kaprekar routine in base b to arrive at Cb, otherwise    Note that we can define sb(i) for all integers i &lt; b5. If i written in base b takes less than 5 digits, the number is padded with leading zero digits until we have 5 digits before applying the Kaprekar routine.  </p>  <p>  Define S(b) as the sum of sb(i) for 0 &lt; i &lt; b5.<br >  E.g. S(15) = 5274369<br />   S(111) = 400668930299  </p>  <p>  Find the sum of S(6k+3) for 2 &le; k &le; 300.<br />  Give the last 18 digits as your answer.  </p>
