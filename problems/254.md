  <p>Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.</p>    <p>Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.</p>    <p>Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.</p>    <p>Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.</p>    <p>Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />&thinsp;sg(i) for 1 &le; i &le; 20 is 156.</p>    <p>What is <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />&thinsp;sg(i) for 1 &le; i &le; 150?</p>
