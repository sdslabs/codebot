   <p>Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.</p> <p>Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.</p> <p>We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a &quot;bouncy&quot; number; for example, 155349.</p> <p>As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 1010.</p> <p>How many numbers below a googol (10100) are not bouncy?</p>
