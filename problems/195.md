  <p>Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.<br />  Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.</p>  <p>There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r &le; 100.  <br />Let T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r &le; n, so<br />   T(100) = 1234,&nbsp; T(1000) = 22767, and&nbsp; T(10000) = 359912.</p>    <p>Find T(1053779).</p>
