  <p>  Every triangle has a circumscribed circle that goes through the three vertices.  Consider all integer sided triangles for which the radius of the circumscribed circle is integral as well.  </p>  <p>  Let S(n) be the sum of the radii of the circumscribed circles of all such triangles for which the radius does not exceed n.  </p>  <p>S(100)=4950 and S(1200)=1653605.  </p>  <p>  Find S(107).  </p>
