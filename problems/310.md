  <p>  Alice and Bob play the game Nim Square.<br />  Nim Square is just like ordinary three-heap normal play Nim, but the players may only remove a square number of stones from a heap.<br />  The number of stones in the three heaps is represented by the ordered triple (a,b,c).<br />  If 0&le;a&le;b&le;c&le;29 then the number of losing positions for the next player is 1160.  </p>  <p>  Find the number of losing positions for the next player if 0&le;a&le;b&le;c&le;100 000.  </p>
