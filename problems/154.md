  <p>A triangular pyramid is constructed using spherical balls so that each ball rests on exactly three balls of the next lower level.</p>  <img src="project/images/p_154_pyramid.gif" width="488" height="379" alt="" />  <p>Then, we calculate the number of paths leading from the apex to each position:</p>  <p>A path starts at the apex and progresses downwards to any of the three spheres directly below the current position.</p>  <p>Consequently, the number of paths to reach a certain position is the sum of the numbers immediately above it (depending on the position, there are up to three numbers above it).</p>  <p>The result is Pascal's pyramid and the numbers at each level n are the coefficients of the trinomial expansion   (x + y + z)n.</p>  <p>How many coefficients in the expansion of (x + y + z)200000 are multiples of 1012?</p>
