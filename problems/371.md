  <p>  Oregon licence plates consist of three letters followed by a three digit number (each digit can be from [0..9]).<br />  While driving to work Seth plays the following game:<br />  Whenever the numbers of two licence plates seen on his trip add to 1000 that's a win.  </p>  <p>  E.g. MIC-012 and HAN-988 is a win and RYU-500 and SET-500 too. (as long as he sees them in the same trip).   <p>  <p>  Find the expected number of plates he needs to see for a win.<br />  Give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.  </p>  <p style="font-size:88%">  Note: We assume that each licence plate seen is equally likely to have any three digit number on it.  </p>
