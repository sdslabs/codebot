  <p>In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, a set of 4 cards is a Badugi if it contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of the same suit.</p>    <p>Let f(n) be the number of ways to choose n cards with a 4 card subset that is a Badugi.  For example, there are 2598960 ways to choose five cards from a standard 52 card deck, of which 514800 contain a 4 card subset that is a Badugi, so f(5) = 514800.</p>    <p>Find <img src='images/symbol_sum.gif' width='11' height='14' alt='&sum;' border='0' style='vertical-align:middle;' />f(n)  for 4 &le; n &le; 13.</p>
