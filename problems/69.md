   <p>Euler's Totient function, &phi;(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, &phi;(9)=6.</p>    n Relatively Prime &phi;(n) n/&phi;(n)   2 1 1 2   3 1,2 2 1.5   4 1,3 2 2   5 1,2,3,4 4 1.25   6 1,5 2 3   7 1,2,3,4,5,6 6 1.1666...   8 1,3,5,7 4 2   9 1,2,4,5,7,8 6 1.5   10 1,3,7,9 4 2.5    <p>It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/&phi;(n) for n &le; 10.</p> <p>Find the value of n &le; 1,000,000 for which n/&phi;(n) is a maximum.</p>
