   <p>A natural number, N, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, {a1, a2, ... , ak} is called a product-sum number: N = a1 + a2 + ... + ak = a1 &times; a2 &times; ... &times; ak.</p> <p>For example, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 &times; 2 &times; 3.</p> <p>For a given set of size, k, we shall call the smallest N with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, k = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are as follows.</p> <p style='margin-left:50px;'>k=2: 4 = 2 &times; 2 = 2 + 2<br /> k=3: 6 = 1 &times; 2 &times; 3 = 1 + 2 + 3<br /> k=4: 8 = 1 &times; 1 &times; 2 &times; 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4<br /> k=5: 8 = 1 &times; 1 &times; 2 &times; 2 &times; 2  = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2<br /> k=6: 12 = 1 &times; 1 &times; 1 &times; 1 &times; 2 &times; 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6</p> <p>Hence for 2&le;k&le;6, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is 4+6+8+12 = 30; note that 8 is only counted once in the sum.</p> <p>In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for 2&le;k&le;12 is {4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16}, the sum is 61.</p> <p>What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for 2&le;k&le;12000?</p>
